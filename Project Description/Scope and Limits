The main scope of this project will be to create a functional mood sensing camera which connects to a separate computer which then outputs an action. If we complete the main scope of the project then we will begin to work on a mobile app to allow an end user to easily configure the camera settings, this will also be very important to showcase our concept. If time permits we will use data from smartwatches as well. We will not explore cloud based storage and processing for our IOT devices in this project as this would be difficult to implement and also increase the processing time and latency for every action our system performs. For the proof of concept prototype only a single camera and upto 1 smartwatch will be used, coding for multiple cameras would use a lot of our limited time.
